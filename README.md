"msd_sim.m"       : simulate a mass-spring-damper (MSD) system a show results emphasisising the energetic properties of the system

"outfbstab_sim.m" : shows the effect of an output feedback stabilising controller.

"eb_pbc.m"        : implements the energy balancing passivity-based control (EB-PBC) on a MSD sys.

"aut_vs_ctrl.m"	  : implements the multistable PBC (on a MSD sys.) and compare the results with the autonomous case $u = 0$
